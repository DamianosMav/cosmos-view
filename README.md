# Astronomy Picture of the Day Viewer
This is a personal project I built using Vue 3 to explore NASA‚Äôs Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. You can browse through space photos, see detailed explanations, and navigate back and forth between days.

# What it does
- Fetches NASA‚Äôs daily astronomy photo along with its title and explanation
- Shows the photo of the current day by default
- Lets you go back to see previous days pictures or forward if you‚Äôre not already viewing today‚Äôs photo
- Clicking the image opens the high-definition version so you can download or view it in full quality
- Has a clean, simple interface that works well on desktop and mobile

# Why I built it
I‚Äôm fascinated by space and love how NASA shares incredible images every day. This app was a fun way to practice Vue 3, work with APIs, and build something visually cool and educational.

# What I learned / used
- Vue 3 Composition API with script setup
- Working with external APIs and handling loading states
- Managing date navigation and disabling buttons based on date limits
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Graceful fallback when API data is unavailable

# Future improvements
- Add error UI instead of alerts
- Allow selecting specific dates from a calendar
